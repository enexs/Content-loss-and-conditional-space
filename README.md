# Content loss and conditional space relationship in conditional generative adversarial networks

This repository is associated with the paper titled as "Content loss and conditional space relationship in conditional generative adversarial networks" submitted to 
TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTER SCIENCES  and  currently under the review stage. 

In this paper, we investigated the behaviour of GAN in the case of shrinking the conditional space and increasing the computational capacity of the generator network.
